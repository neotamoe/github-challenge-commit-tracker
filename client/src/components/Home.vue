        <p>But I also get the sense that there's a hunger that's deeper than that - a hunger that goes beyond any 
            single cause or issue. They weren't simply a religious leader's effort to speak out against perceived 
            injustice. It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, 
            but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for 
            American workers, and play by the rules of the road. Together, you represent the harmony between 
            tradition and progress. It is easy to point fingers - for Palestinians to point to the displacement 
            brought by Israel's founding, and for Israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout 
            its history from within its borders as well as beyond. Those are not just American ideas, they are human 
            rights, and that is why we will support them everywhere.</p><br/>

        <p>This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace 
            to bridge divides and unite in common effort. Our problems must be dealt with through partnership; progress 
            must be shared.</p><br/>

        <p>These enemies must be found. And until we stop the genocide that's being carried out in Darfur as I speak, 
            our conscience cannot rest. We can tackle race only as spectacle - as we did in the OJ trial - or in the 
            wake of tragedy, as we did in the aftermath of Katrina - or as fodder for the nightly news. The Arab-Israeli 
            conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems. And fault 
            lines must be closed among Muslims as well, as the divisions between Sunni and Shia have led to tragic violence, 
            particularly in Iraq.</p><br/>

        <p>Thank you, and God bless America.</p>
