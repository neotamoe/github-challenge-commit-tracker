# Github Commit Challenge Tracker
## PLEASE NOTE: This is a work in progress...
This project was created as a way to help me learn Vue.js and also try to solve a problem.  I wanted to create an app that 
could be used to track participation in a 30 day Github Commit Challenge (where participants strive to make at least one
commit per day to further their learning and skills).

## Tech Stack
* Vue.js
* MongoDB
* Express
* Node
* Bulma (styling)
