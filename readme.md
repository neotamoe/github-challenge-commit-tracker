# Github Commit Challenge Tracker
## PLEASE NOTE: This is a work in progress...
This project was created as a way to help me learn Vue.js and also try to solve a problem.  I wanted to create an app that 
could be used to track participation in a 30 day Github Commit Challenge (where participants strive to make at least one
commit per day to further their learning and skills).

## Tech Stack
* Vue.js
* MongoDB
* Express
* Node
* Bulma (styling)

## Note to dev self - WIP
For some reason, this project is currently set up with yarn.  It may make more sense to switch it to use the npm scripts built in to the package.json before the project is finalized.  For now, however, 

* To start front end, use terminal to navigate to the client folder.  Enter `yarn serve`.
* To start back end, use terminal to navigate to the server folder.  Enter `npm start`.
