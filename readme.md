# WARNING!  This is an abandoned project!
It was used to explore Vue.js, but abandoned for other learning goals and a change in learning priorities.  Perhaps this will be picked up in the future (but more likely not), but this writer wants it to be clear that this project is 1) not finished and 2) an exploration of Vue.  This project will likely not be picked up again, but could be considered an abandoned work in progress.

While I enjoyed working in Vue, I did not fully explore its capabilities.  However, the documentation was clear and I appreciated the ability to keep styling scoped to a particular component and keep the logic within the component as well.  That said, this project alone was not sufficient for me to feel fully confident in rendering a strong opinion on the pros and cons of working in Vue.  I look forward to a future time where I can re-explore Vue with a clearer project plan.  


# Github Commit Challenge Tracker

This project was created as a way to help me learn Vue.js and also try to solve a problem.  I wanted to create an app that 
could be used to track participation in a 30 day Github Commit Challenge (where participants strive to make at least one
commit per day to further their learning and skills).

## Tech Stack
* Vue.js
* MongoDB
* Express
* Node
* Bulma (styling)

## Note to dev self - WIP
For some reason, this project is currently set up with yarn.  It may make more sense to switch it to use the npm scripts built in to the package.json before the project is finalized.  For now, however, 

* To start front end, use terminal to navigate to the client folder.  Enter `yarn serve`.
* To start back end, use terminal to navigate to the server folder.  Enter `npm start`.
